- Variable names should use **camel case**, which is a style of writing that uses a lower-case letter at the beginning of the first word and an upper-case letter at the beginning of each subsequent word. For example, `string thisIsCamelCase;`.
- Variable names should begin with an alphabetical letter. Developers use the underscore for a special purpose, so try to not use that for now.
- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful in your app. Choose a name for your variable that represents the kind of data it will hold.
- Variable names should be one or more entire words appended together. Don't use contractions or abbreviations because the name of the variable (and therefore, its purpose) may be unclear to others who are reading your code.
- Variable names shouldn't include the data type of the variable. You might see some advice to use a style like `string strValue;`. That advice is no longer current.
