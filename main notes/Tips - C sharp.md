1. You write the data type frist when declearing a variable.
	eg:- 
	
	``` C#
	string name = "Gaurav";
```
2.  Here variables follow the camel casing and the data-types are written in lower caps. 
3. When working with floating pointers keep in mind that you will need to use an alphabet as a suffix. float = f, double = d, decimal = m. It is used to make constanst into the desired data- types eg.- when using 5 in a operation with float use 5f.  
4. In order to change the datatype you must name the datatype in paranthesis before the operation
	``` C#
	decimal div = (decimal)one / (decimal)two;
```
5. value++ means the increment will happen after the value is used and vice versa.
