```C#
string A = String.Join(",", strings);
```

- `Join()` creates a string with the elements of an array.
- First we declear a string here it is `string A`.
- Then we write `String.Join()` since `Join` is a method of `String` class.
- Then we pass two parameters one is the seperator in double quotes here it is `.`  but we can even leave it empty by just writing `""` .
- Second parameter is the array we want this to happen on.
