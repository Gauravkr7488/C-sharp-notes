From your previous experience with the `Console.WriteLine()` method, you should already know the basics:

- Start by typing the class name. In this case, the class name is `Console`.
- Add the member access operator, the `.` symbol.
- Add the method's name. In this case, the method's name is `WriteLine`.
- Add the method invocation operator, which is a set of parentheses `()`.
- Finally, specify the arguments that are passed to the method, if there are any, between the parentheses of the method invocation operator. In this case, you specify the text that you want the `Console.WriteLine()` method to write to the console (for example, `"Hello World!"`).

Optionally, depending on how the developers designed and implemented the given method, you may also need to:

- Pass additional values as input parameters.
- Accept a return value.
