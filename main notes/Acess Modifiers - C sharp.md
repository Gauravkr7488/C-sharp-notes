- `public` - The code is accessible for all classes
- `private` - The code is only accessible within the same class
- `protected` - The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class. You will learn more about inheritance in a later chapter
- `internal` -  The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly. You will learn more about this in a later chapter
- There's also two combinations: `protected internal` and `private protected`.
